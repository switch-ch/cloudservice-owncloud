CESNET Experiences
====================

This chapter discusses technical challenges we have faced and experiences
we have gained while deploying and running the ownCloud service.

Deployment
----------

When we started deploying the ownCloud service, Puppet made our lives much
easier. We were benefiting from an already existing Puppet infrastructure
that is used to manage the whole storage infrastructure
and some basic Puppet modules from which we could build the service. It
would certainly be much more uncomfortable experience to configure and
deploy all pieces needed to each node manually (or in an 'ssh in a for loop' way).

Puppet automated most of the deployment tasks for us.
We developed modules for each service, then specified to which
nodes to deploy the services and watched Puppet do its job. With this approach, we are able to easily add more nodes to our ownCloud cluster or to deploy the same setup onto a different site.

HA Configuration
----------------

The only major things we kept away from the Puppet's reach were filesystem preparation and a Pacemaker HA configuration. Preparing a filesystem was pretty straightforward, but setting
up a HA cluster has proven to be a major challenge for us. We had to prepare RA's (Resource
Agents) for some component desired to run in HA mode. 
As the number of services managed by Pacemaker grown up in time, the whole configuration of proper linkage between services and hosts become more and more complex. The most time consuming and problematic part was the fine tuning of timeout parameters of basic actions of all services. In normal non stressful conditions setted up timeouts were too low in some stress conditions. This behaviour led to strange and difficult to identify restarts of services and in some cases whole nodes.
But nowadays, after hours and hours of tuning, we can say, that it's pretty stable and behaves the way we expect it to.

ownCloud Application
--------------------

For the time we were running our ownCloud service, we have stumbled upon
a handful of interesting software problems / bugs, both in ownCloud and
synchronization clients. Some of them are described in the following section.

User Files Coming from the Future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Among the first things we observed (and we are still observing) in our logs
were errors like this::

	{...,An exception occurred while executing
	UPDATE "oc_filecache" SET "mtime" = ?, "etag" = ?, \"storage_mtime\"=?
	WHERE "fileid" = ?: SQLSTATE[22003]: Numeric value out of range: 7
	ERROR:  value \"2497698996\" is out of range for type integer"...}

Root cause of these errors seemed to be that files with bad mtimes were
synchronized to us from the user clients. Many of those files were
coming from a cameras without a properly set date, or any other
misconfigured devices. This caused sync problems and even unability
to log in for the one of the users. But right now we don't have a better
solution other than to recommend users to watch out for these files.
The issue is currently being discussed in this ticket_ as a bug.

Cron Job Traffic Jam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a long time, we have been fighting with a steadily increasing ownCloud website response times.
It got to the point where it was a way too sluggish at a given number of users and usage.
When looking at the page loading times, it took most of the time to load generated JS
files like 'core.js'. But after some XDEBUG profiling we started to suspect the database
to be the major bottleneck. Database node had all CPU cores utilized to the max
almost all the time. The response times of database backend were way too high.
PgPool II deployment and PostgreSQL configuration tuning helped for a while, but after
few months it got worse again.

One could think that this could be attributed to a big gain of users in October 2014
as you can see in our ownCloud statistics_. But when we started looking at a queries that
were being executed on the database, we saw that almost **90%** of them were just SELECTs
on the 'oc_jobs' table::

	SELECT `id`, `class`, `last_run`, `argument` FROM `oc_jobs` WHERE `id` > ? ORDER BY `id` ASC

The 'oc_jobs' table also counted more than 80,000 rows. This was a clear indication that the ownCloud's
cron job (cron.php script which is supposed to delete old temporary files and clean
the 'oc_jobs' and other DB tables) didn't do its job properly. Cron job was configured to be
executed by the system cron. It was executing every 15 minutes, but it did nothing.

Then we realized that this was because of an existing lockfile placed inside ownCloud's data
folder. This must have been left there for a long time by some previous cron job run (which must 
have ended really badly). We however didn't isolate the source of those SELECTs. But after we removed
that lockfile and ran the cron job again, there were only 2 records left in the 'oc_jobs' table. Since then,
ownCloud's overall performance went dramatically up and is up to our expectations. We are now serving
more than 2600 users still on a single Apache & DB instance without any load balancing. And we are
expecting to serve even more using this setup for the following months.
