Goals
-----

As we NRENs start to implement cloud services, we are all facing similar
challenges and problems. In order to reduce the amount of separate work,
discovery and solving of problemns, the NREN community is collaborating on a set
of guides for various services that cover items from the following list:

* Service Definition
* Implementation
* Operations
* Legal Aspects / SLA
* Tariff Models
* Real World Experiences / Use Cases

This book specifically covers a file sync and share service based on ownCloud_.
However, the non-technical chapters are applicable to other sync & share
services.

Audience
--------

Project teams in NRENs that are tasked with designing, building, implementing
and running a ownCloud based service for their community.

History
-------

This book is a collaborative effort of the European NREN community, organized
in TERENA and GEANT. It has started as a project of the GN3+ SA7 project.

The technical parts are based on the implemention of ownCloud at SWITCH, with
the SWITCHdrive_ project. It can serve as one example of how one might
technically build such a service.

As of October 2014 a section describing the implementation of ownCloud at GARR,
with the GARRbox_ service, has been added.
