Service Description
===================

The success of commercial file sharing solutions like Dropbox_, `Google Drive`_
and others have led many users to utilize those service for file and document
sharing and collaboration.

Information that is stored on one computer can easily be synced to other
computers owned by the same user, mobile devices and also shared with colleagues
and collaborators.

Members of universities and institutions in general use their own devices to manage their data as well as data the is processed in the context of the institution. A survey of SWITCH showed that about 55 percent of university members who use Dropbox_ use it to store university data, most of the time along with private data. In the view of the management of those institutions this is problematic due to legal reasons, protection of intellectual property and sometimes even not in line with the current policies. This makes the case for local sync and share services and calls for a provider to host the service. In the higher education world, hosting of such a service is naturally a task for an NREN.

SWITCH evaluated ownCloud together with the IT services of the universities and beta test users who provided feedback. In short, the conclusion was that the key success factor for a service was the uptake by users. A solution with  functionality and a user interface (usability) comparable to commercial solutions seemed to be the candidate to support that factor.

ownCloud was one of the solutions to fulfil all of the following key requirements:

* On-premise solution (Swiss data location and compliance with Swiss data protection law)
* High usability (user interface and functionality)
* Support of desktop and mobile operating systems
* Access control with AAI
